# Factors influencing R0 Simulation Experiment
The goal of this simulation study is to determine which factors have the greatest influence on epidemic outcomes. Here we are explicitly dividing the factors into two distinct categories: 1) disease ecology and 2) landscape structure.

## Glossary:
R0 = basic reproduction number\
P0 = initial population size\
B = Beta (simulation parameter for # spores dispersing per unit time under optimal conditions)\
LP = latent period\
IP = infectious period\
CP = contiguous premises (in the context of CP cull)\

## Experimental Setup

Run all simulations on a 200 x 200 area. We are keeping total amount of host constant but varying spatial arrangement.

### Factorial of Lifecycle Factors
5 B = (1.25, 2, 4, 8, 16)\
5 P0 = (1, 5, 10, 50, 100) % infection at the epidemic outbreak\
4 LP = (2, 4, 8, 16)\


### Add in Landscape complexity

### Add in treatment effects
#### Cull timing and size effects

#### Vaccination/Pesticide/Fungicide effects
